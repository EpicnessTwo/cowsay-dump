| Mathemeticians stand on each other's    |
| shoulders while computer scientists     |
| stand on each other's toes. -- Richard  |
| Hamming It has been said that           |
| physicists stand on one another's       |
| shoulders. If this is the case, then    |
| programmers stand on one another's      |
| toes, and software engineers dig each   |
\ other's graves. -- Unknown              /
