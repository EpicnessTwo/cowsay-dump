/ The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy    \
| has a few things to say on the subject  |
| of towels. Most importantly, a towel    |
| has immense psychological value. For    |
| some reason, if a non-hitchhiker        |
| discovers that a hitchhiker has his     |
| towel with him, he will automatically   |
| assume that he is also in possession of |
| a toothbrush, washcloth, flask, gnat    |
| spray, space suit, etc., etc.           |
| Furthermore, the non-hitchhiker will    |
| then happily lend the hitchhiker any of |
| these or a dozen other items that he    |
| may have "lost". After all, any man who |
| can hitch the length and breadth of the |
| Galaxy, struggle against terrible odds, |
| win through and still know where his    |
| towel is, is clearly a man to be        |
| reckoned with. -- Douglas Adams, "The   |
\ Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"       /
