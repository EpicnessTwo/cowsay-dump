/ Management: How many feet do mice have? \
| Reply: Mice have four feet. M:          |
| Elaborate! R: Mice have five            |
| appendages, and four of them are feet.  |
| M: No discussion of fifth appendage! R: |
| Mice have five appendages; four of them |
| are feet; one is a tail. M: What? Feet  |
| with no legs? R: Mice have four legs,   |
| four feet, and one tail per unit-mouse. |
| M: Confusing -- is that a total of 9    |
| appendages? R: Mice have four leg-foot  |
| assemblies and one tail assembly per    |
| body. M: Does not fully discuss the     |
| issue! R: Each mouse comes equipped     |
| with four legs and a tail. Each leg is  |
| equipped with a foot at the end         |
| opposite the body; the tail is not      |
| equipped with a foot. M: Descriptive?   |
| Yes. Forceful NO! R: Allotment of       |
| appendages for mice will be: Four       |
| foot-leg assemblies, one tail.          |
| Deviation from this policy is not       |
| permitted as it would constitute        |
| misapportionment of scarce appendage    |
| assets. M: Too authoritarian; stifles   |
| creativity! R: Mice have four feet;     |
| each foot is attached to a small leg    |
| joined integrally with the overall      |
| mouse structural sub-system. Also       |
| attached to the mouse sub-system is a   |
| thin tail, non-functional and           |
| ornamental in nature. M: Too            |
| verbose/scientific. Answer the          |
\ question! R: Mice have four feet.       /
