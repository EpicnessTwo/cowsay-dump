/ Every man is apt to form his notions of \
| things difficult to be apprehended, or  |
| less familiar, from their analogy to    |
| things which are more familiar. Thus,   |
| if a man bred to the seafaring life,    |
| and accustomed to think and talk only   |
| of matters relating to navigation,      |
| enters into discourse upon any other    |
| subject; it is well known, that the     |
| language and the notions proper to his  |
| own profession are infused into every   |
| subject, and all things are measured by |
| the rules of navigation: and if he      |
| should take it into his head to         |
| philosophize concerning the faculties   |
| of the mind, it cannot be doubted, but  |
| he would draw his notions from the      |
| fabric of the ship, and would find in   |
| the mind, sails, masts, rudder, and     |
| compass. -- Thomas Reid, "An Inquiry    |
\ into the Human Mind", 1764              /
