/ Dear Emily, what about test messages?   \
| -- Concerned Dear Concerned: It is      |
| important, when testing, to test the    |
| entire net. Never test merely a subnet  |
| distribution when the whole net can be  |
| done. Also put "please ignore" on your  |
| test messages, since we all know that   |
| everybody always skips a message with a |
| line like that. Don't use a subject     |
| like "My sex is female but I demand to  |
| be addressed as male." because such     |
| articles are read in depth by all       |
