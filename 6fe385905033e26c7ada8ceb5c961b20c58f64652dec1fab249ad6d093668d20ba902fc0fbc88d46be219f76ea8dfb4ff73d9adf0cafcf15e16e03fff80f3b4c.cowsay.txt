/ Even if we put all these nagging        \
| thoughts [four embarrassing questions   |
| about astrology] aside for a moment,    |
| one overriding question remains to be   |
| asked. Why would the positions of       |
| celestial objects at the moment of      |
| birth have an effect on our characters, |
| lives, or destinies? What force or      |
| influence, what sort of energy would    |
| travel from the planets and stars to    |
| all human beings and affect our         |
| development or fate? No amount of       |
| scientific-sounding jargon or           |
| computerized calculations by            |
| astrologers can disguise this central   |
| problem with astrology -- we can find   |
| no evidence of a mechanism by which     |
| celestial objects can influence us in   |
| so specific and personal a way. . . .   |
| Some astrologers argue that there may   |
| be a still unknown force that           |
| represents the astrological influence.  |
| . . .If so, astrological predictions -- |
| like those of any scientific field --   |
| should be easily tested. . . .          |
| Astrologers always claim to be just a   |
| little too busy to carry out such       |
| careful tests of their efficacy, so in  |
| the last two decades scientists and     |
| statisticians have generously done such |
| testing for them. There have been       |
| dozens of well-designed tests all       |
| around the world, and astrology has     |
| failed every one of them. . . . I       |
| propose that we let those beckoning     |
| lights in the sky awaken our interest   |
| in the real (and fascinating) universe  |
| beyond our planet, and not let them     |
| keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left |
| over from a time when we huddled by the |
| firelight, afraid of the night. --      |
