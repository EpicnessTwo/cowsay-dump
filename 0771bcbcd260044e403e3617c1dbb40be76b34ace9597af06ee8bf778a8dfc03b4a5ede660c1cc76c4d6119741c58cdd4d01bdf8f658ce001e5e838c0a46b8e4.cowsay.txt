/ Once there was this conductor see, who  \
| had a bass problem. You see, during a   |
| portion of Beethovan's Ninth Symphony   |
| in which there are no bass violin       |
| parts, one of the bassists always       |
| passed a bottle of scotch around. So,   |
| to remind himself that the basses       |
| usually required an extra cue towards   |
| the end of the symphony, the conductor  |
| would fasten a piece of string around   |
| the page of the score before the bass   |
| cue. As the basses grew more and more   |
| inebriated, two of them fell asleep.    |
| The conductor grew quite nervous (he    |
| was very concerned about the pitch)     |
| because it was the bottom of the ninth; |
| the score was tied and the basses were  |
\ loaded with two out.                    /
