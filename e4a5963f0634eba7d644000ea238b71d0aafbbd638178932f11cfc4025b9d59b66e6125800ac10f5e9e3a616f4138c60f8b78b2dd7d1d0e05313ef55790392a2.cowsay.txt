/ You first have to decide whether to use \
| the short or the long form. The short   |
| form is what the Internal Revenue       |
| Service calls "simplified", which means |
| it is designed for people who need the  |
| help of a Sears tax-preparation expert  |
| to distinguish between their first and  |
| last names. Here's the complete text:   |
| "(1) How much did you make? (AMOUNT)    |
| (2) How much did we here at the         |
| government take out? (AMOUNT) (3) Hey!  |
| Sounds like we took too much! So we're  |
| going to send an official government    |
| check for (ONE-FIFTEENTH OF THE AMOUNT  |
| WE TOOK) directly to the (YOUR LAST     |
| NAME) household at (YOUR ADDRESS), for  |
| you to spend in any way you please!     |
| Which just goes to show you, (YOUR      |
| FIRST NAME), that it pays to file the   |
| short form!" The IRS wants you to use   |
| this form because it gets to keep most  |
| of your money. So unless you have pond  |
| silt for brains, you want the long      |
| form. -- Dave Barry, "Sweating Out      |
