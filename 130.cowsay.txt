/ The challenge of space exploration and  \
| particularly of landing men on the moon |
| represents the greatest challenge which |
| has ever faced the human race. Even if  |
| there were no clear scientific or other |
| arguments for proceeding with this      |
| task, the whole history of our          |
| civilization would still impel men      |
| toward the goal. In fact, the assembly  |
| of the scientific and military with     |
| these human arguments creates such an   |
| overwhelming case that in can be        |
| ignored only by those who are blind to  |
| the teachings of history, or who wish   |
| to suspend the development of           |
| civilization at its moment of greatest  |
| opportunity and drama. - Sir Bernard    |
| Lovell, 1962, in "The History of Manned |
\ Space Flight"                           /
