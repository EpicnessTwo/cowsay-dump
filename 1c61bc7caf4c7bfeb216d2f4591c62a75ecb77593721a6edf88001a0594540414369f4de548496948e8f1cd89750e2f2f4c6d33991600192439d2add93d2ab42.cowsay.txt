/ Good government never depends upon      \
| laws, but upon the personal qualities   |
| of those who govern. The machinery of   |
| government is always subordinate to the |
| will of those who administer that       |
| machinery. The most important element   |
| of government, therefore, is the method |
| of choosing leaders. -- Frank Herbert,  |
