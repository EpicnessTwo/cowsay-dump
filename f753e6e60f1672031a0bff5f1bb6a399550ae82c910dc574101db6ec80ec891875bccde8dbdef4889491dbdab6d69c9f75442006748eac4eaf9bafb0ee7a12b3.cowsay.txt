/ `Lasu' Releases SAG 0.3 -- Freeware     \
| Book Takes Paves For New World Order by |
| staff writers Helsinki, Finland, August |
| 6, 1995 -- In a surprise movement, Lars |
| ``Lasu'' Wirzenius today released the   |
| 0.3 edition of the ``Linux System       |
| Administrators' Guide''. Already an     |
| industry non-classic, the new version   |
| sports such overwhelming features as an |
| overview of a Linux system, a           |
| completely new climbing session in a    |
| tree, and a list of acknowledgements in |
| the introduction. The SAG, as the book  |
| is affectionately called, is one of the |
| corner stones of the Linux              |
| Documentation Project. ``We at the LDP  |
| feel that we wouldn't be able to        |
| produce anything at all, that all our   |
| work would be futile, if it weren't for |
| the SAG,'' says Matt Welsh, director of |
| LDP, Inc. The new version is still      |
| distributed freely, now even with a     |
| copyright that allows modification.     |
| ``More dough,'' explains the author.    |
| Despite insistent rumors about blatant  |
| commercialization, the SAG will         |
| probably remain free. ``Even more       |
| dough,'' promises the author. The       |
| author refuses to comment on Windows NT |
| and Windows 96 versions, claiming not   |
| to understand what the question is      |
| about. Industry gossip, however, tells  |
| that Bill Gates, co-founder and CEO of  |
| Microsoft, producer of the Windows      |
| series of video games, has visited      |
| Helsinki several times this year.       |
| Despite of this, Linus Torvalds, author |
| of the word processor Linux with which  |
| the SAG was written, is not worried.    |
| ``We'll have world domination real soon |
| now, anyway,'' he explains, ``for 1.4   |
| at the lastest.'' ... -- Lars Wirzenius |
