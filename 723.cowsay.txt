/ I lately lost a preposition; It hid, I  \
| thought, beneath my chair And angrily I |
| cried, "Perdition! Up from out of under |
| there." Correctness is my vade mecum,   |
| And straggling phrases I abhor, And yet |
| I wondered, "What should he come Up     |
| from out of under for?" -- Morris       |
