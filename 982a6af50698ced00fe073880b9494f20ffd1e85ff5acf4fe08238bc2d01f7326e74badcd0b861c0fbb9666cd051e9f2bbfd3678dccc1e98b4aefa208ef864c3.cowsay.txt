/ This is where the bloodthirsty license  \
| agreement is supposed to go, explaining |
| that Interactive Easyflow is a          |
| copyrighted package licensed for use by |
| a single person, and sternly warning    |
| you not to pirate copies of it and      |
| explaining, in detail, the gory         |
| consequences if you do. We know that    |
| you are an honest person, and are not   |
| going to go around pirating copies of   |
| Interactive Easyflow; this is just as   |
| well with us since we worked hard to    |
| perfect it and selling copies of it is  |
| our only method of making anything out  |
| of all the hard work. If, on the other  |
| hand, you are one of those few people   |
| who do go around pirating copies of     |
| software you probably aren't going to   |
| pay much attention to a license         |
| agreement, bloodthirsty or not. Just    |
| keep your doors locked and look out for |
| the HavenTree attack shark. -- License  |
