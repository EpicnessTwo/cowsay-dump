| Everclear brand grain alcohol Mix       |
| JELL-O and Knox gelatin into 2 cups of  |
| boiling water. Stir 'til fully          |
| dissolved. Pour hot mixture into a flat |
| pan. (JELL-O molds won't work.) Stir in |
| grain alcohol instead of usual cold     |
| water. Remove any congealing glops of   |
| slime. (Alcohol has an unusual effect   |
| on excess JELL-O.) Pour in fruit to     |
| desired taste, and to absorb any excess |
| alcohol. Mix in some cold water to      |
| dilute the alcohol and make it easier   |
| to eat for the faint of heart.          |
| Refrigerate overnight to allow mixture  |
| to fully harden. (About 8-12 hours.)    |
| Cut into squares and enjoy! WARNING:    |
| Keep ingredients away from open flame.  |
