/ In high school in Brooklyn I was the    \
| baseball manager, proud as I could be I |
| chased baseballs, gathered thrown bats  |
| handed out the towels Eventually, I     |
| bought my own It was very important     |
| work but it was dark blue while for a   |
| small spastic kid, the official ones    |
| were green but I was a team member      |
| Nobody ever said anything When the team |
| got to me about my blue jacket; their   |
| warm-up jackets the guys were my        |
| friends I didn't get one Yet it hurt me |
| all year Only the regular team to wear  |
| that blue jacket got these jackets, and |
| among all those green ones surely not a |
| manager Even now, forty years after, I  |
| still recall that jacket and the memory |
| goes on hurting. -- Bart Lanier Safford |
