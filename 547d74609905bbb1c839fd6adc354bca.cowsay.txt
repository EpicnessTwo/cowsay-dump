/ MVS Air Lines: The passengers all       \
| gather in the hangar, watching hundreds |
| of technicians check the flight systems |
| on this immense, luxury aircraft. This  |
| plane has at least 10 engines and seats |
| over 1,000 passengers; bigger models in |
| the fleet can have more engines than    |
| anyone can count and fly even more      |
| passengers than there are on Earth. It  |
| is claimed to cost less per passenger   |
| mile to operate these humungous planes  |
| than any other aircraft ever built,     |
| unless you personally have to pay for   |
| the ticket. All the passengers scramble |
| aboard, as do the 200 technicians       |
| needed to keep it from crashing. The    |
| pilot takes his place up in the glass   |
| cockpit. He guns the engines, only to   |
| realise that the plane is too big to    |
\ get through the hangar doors.           /
