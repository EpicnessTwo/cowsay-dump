/ In the beginning there was only one     \
| kind of Mathematician, created by the   |
| Great Mathamatical Spirit form the      |
| Book: the Topologist. And they grew to  |
| large numbers and prospered. One day    |
| they looked up in the heavens and       |
| desired to reach up as far as the eye   |
| could see. So they set out in building  |
| a Mathematical edifice that was to      |
| reach up as far as "up" went. Further   |
| and further up they went ... until one  |
| night the edifice collapsed under the   |
| weight of paradox. The following        |
| morning saw only rubble where there     |
| once was a huge structure reaching to   |
| the heavens. One by one, the            |
| Mathematicians climbed out from under   |
| the rubble. It was a miracle that       |
| nobody was killed; but when they began  |
| to speak to one another, SUPRISE of all |
| suprises! they could not understand     |
| each other. They all spoke different    |
| languages. They all fought amongst      |
| themselves and each went about their    |
| own way. To this day the Topologists    |
| remain the original Mathematicians. --  |
