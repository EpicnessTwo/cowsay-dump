/ Those who sweat in flames of hell,      \
| Leaden eared, some thought their bowels |
| Here's the reason that they fell:       |
| Lispeth forth the sweetest vowels.      |
| While on earth they prayed in SAS,      |
| These they offered up in praise PL/1,   |
| or other crass, Thinking all this fetid |
| haze Vulgar tongue. A rapsody sung.     |
| Some the lord did sorely try Jabber of  |
| the mindless horde Assembling all their |
| pleas in hex. Sequel next did mock the  |
| lord Speech as crabbed as devil's       |
| crable Slothful sequel so enfangled Hex |
| that marked on Tower Babel Its          |
| speaker's lips became entangled The     |
| highest rung. In his bung. Because in   |
| life they prayed so ill And offered god |
| such swinish swill Now they sweat in    |
| flames of hell Sweat from lack of APL   |
\ Sweat dung!                             /
