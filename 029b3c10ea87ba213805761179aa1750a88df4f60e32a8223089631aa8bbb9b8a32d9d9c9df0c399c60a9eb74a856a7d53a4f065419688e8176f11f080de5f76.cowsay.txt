/ It might be worth reflecting that this  \
| group was originally created back in    |
| September of 1987 and has exchanged     |
| over 1200 messages. The original        |
| announcement for the group called for   |
| an all inclusive discussion ranging     |
| from the writings of Gibson and Vinge   |
| and movies like Bladerunner to real     |
| world things like Brands' description   |
| of the work being done at the MIT Media |
| Lab. It was meant as a haven for people |
| with vision of this scope. If you want  |
| to create a haven for people with       |
| narrower visions, feel free. But I feel |
| sad for anyone who thinks that          |
| alt.cyberpunk is such a monstrous group |
| that it is in dire need of being        |
| subdivided. Heaven help them if they    |
| ever start reading comp.arch or         |
