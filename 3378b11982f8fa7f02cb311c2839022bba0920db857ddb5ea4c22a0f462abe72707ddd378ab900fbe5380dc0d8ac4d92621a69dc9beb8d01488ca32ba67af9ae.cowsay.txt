/ The Least Successful Police Dogs        \
| America has a very strong candidate in  |
| "La Dur", a fearsome looking schnauzer  |
| hound, who was retired from the Orlando |
| police force in Florida in 1978. He     |
| consistently refused to do anything     |
| which might ruffle or offend the        |
| criminal classes. His handling officer, |
| Rick Grim, had to admit: "He just won't |
| go up and bite them. I got sick and     |
| tired of doing that dog's work for      |
| him." The British contenders in this    |
| category, however, took things a stage  |
| further. "Laddie" and "Boy" were        |
| trained as detector dogs for drug       |
| raids. Their employment was terminated  |
| following a raid in the Midlands in     |
| 1967. While the investigating officer   |
| questioned two suspects, they patted    |
| and stroked the dogs who eventually     |
| fell asleep in front of the fire. When  |
| the officer moved to arrest the         |
| suspects, one dog growled at him while  |
| the other leapt up and bit his thigh.   |
