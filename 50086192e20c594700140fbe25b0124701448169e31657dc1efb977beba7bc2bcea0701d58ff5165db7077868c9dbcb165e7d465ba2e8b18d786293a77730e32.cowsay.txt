/ My message is not that biological       \
| determinists were bad scientists or     |
| even that they were always wrong.       |
| Rather, I believe that science must be  |
| understood as a social phenomenon, a    |
| gutsy, human enterprise, not the work   |
| of robots programmed to collect pure    |
| information. I also present this view   |
| as an upbeat for science, not as a      |
| gloomy epitaph for a noble hope         |
| sacrificed on the alter of human        |
| limitations. I believe that a factual   |
| reality exists and that science, though |
| often in an obtuse and erratic manner,  |
| can learn about it. Galileo was not     |
| shown the instruments of torture in an  |
| abstract debate about lunar motion. He  |
| had threatened the Church's             |
| conventional argument for social and    |
| doctrinal stability: the static world   |
| order with planets circling about a     |
| central earth, priests subordinate to   |
| the Pope and serfs to their lord. But   |
| the Church soon made its peace with     |
| Galileo's cosmology. They had no        |
| choice; the earth really does revolve   |
| about the sun. -- S.J. Gould, "The      |
\ Mismeasure of Man"                      /
