/ When someone makes a move We'll send    \
| them all we've got, Of which we don't   |
| approve, John Wayne and Randolph Scott, |
| Who is it that always intervenes?       |
| Remember those exciting fighting        |
| scenes? U.N. and O.A.S., To the shores  |
| of Tripoli, They have their place, I    |
| guess, But not to Mississippoli, But    |
| first, send the Marines! What do we do? |
| We send the Marines! For might makes    |
| right, Members of the corps And till    |
| they've seen the light, All hate the    |
| thought of war: They've got to be       |
| protected, They'd rather kill them off  |
| by peaceful means. All their rights     |
| respected, Stop calling it aggression-- |
| Till somebody we like can be elected.   |
| We hate that expression! We only want   |
| the world to know That we support the   |
| status quo; They love us everywhere we  |
| go, So when in doubt, send the Marines! |
