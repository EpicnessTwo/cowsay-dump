/ Eudaemonic research proceeded with the  \
| casual mania peculiar to this part of   |
| the world. Nude sunbathing on the back  |
| deck was combined with phone calls to   |
| Advanced Kinetics in Costa Mesa,        |
| American Laser Systems in Goleta,       |
| Automation Industries in Danbury,       |
| Connecticut, Arenberg Ultrasonics in    |
| Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, and       |
| Hewlett Packard in Sunnyvale,           |
| California, where Norman Packard's      |
| cousin, David, presided as chairman of  |
| the board. The trick was to make these  |
| calls at noon, in the hope that         |
| out-to-lunch executives would return    |
| them at their own expense. Eudaemonic   |
| Enterprises, for all they knew, might   |
| be a fast-growing computer company      |
| branching out of the Silicon Valley.    |
| Sniffing the possibility of high-volume |
| sales, these executives little          |
| suspected that they were talking on the |
| other end of the line to a naked        |
| physicist crazed over roulette. --      |
