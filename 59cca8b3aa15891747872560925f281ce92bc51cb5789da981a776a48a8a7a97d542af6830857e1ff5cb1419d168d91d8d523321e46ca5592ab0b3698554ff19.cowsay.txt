/ Festivity Level 1: Your guests are      \
| chatting amiably with each other,       |
| admiring your Christmas-tree ornaments, |
| singing carols around the upright       |
| piano, sipping at their drinks and      |
| nibbling hors d'oeuvres. Festivity      |
| Level 2: Your guests are talking loudly |
| -- sometimes to each other, and         |
| sometimes to nobody at all, rearranging |
| your Christmas-tree ornaments, singing  |
| "I Gotta Be Me" around the upright      |
| piano, gulping their drinks and wolfing |
| down hors d'oeuvres. Festivity Level 3: |
| Your guests are arguing violently with  |
| inanimate objects, singing "I can't get |
| no satisfaction," gulping down other    |
| peoples' drinks, wolfing down Christmas |
| tree ornaments and placing hors         |
| d'oeuvres in the upright piano to see   |
| what happens when the little hammers    |
| strike. Festivity Level 4: Your guests, |
| hors d'oeuvres smeared all over their   |
| naked bodies are performing a ritual    |
| dance around the burning Christmas      |
| tree. The piano is missing. You want to |
| keep your party somewhere around level  |
| 3, unless you rent your home and own    |
| Firearms, in which case you can go to   |
| level 4. The best way to get to level 3 |
