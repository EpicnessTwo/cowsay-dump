/ And now your toner's toney, Disk blocks \
| aplenty And your paper near pure white, |
| Await your laser drawn lines, The       |
| smudges on your soul are gone Your      |
| intricate fonts, And your output's      |
| clean as light.. Your pictures and      |
| signs. We've labored with your father,  |
| Your amputative absence The venerable   |
| XGP, Has made the Ten dumb, But his     |
| slow artistic hand, Without you, Dover, |
| Lacks your clean velocity. We're system |
| untounged- Theses and papers DRAW Plots |
| and TEXage And code in a queue Have     |
| been biding their time, Dover, oh       |
| Dover, With LISP code and programs,     |
| We've been waiting for you. And this    |
| crufty rhyme. Dover, oh Dover, Dover,   |
| oh Dover, arisen from dead. We welcome  |
| you back, Dover, oh Dover, awoken from  |
| bed. Though still you may jam, Dover,   |
| oh Dover, welcome back to the Lab.      |
| You're on the right track. Dover, oh    |
\ Dover, we've missed your clean hand...  /
