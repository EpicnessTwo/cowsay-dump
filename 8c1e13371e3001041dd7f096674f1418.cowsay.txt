/ Florence Flask was ... dressing for the \
| opera when she turned to her husband    |
| and screamed, "Erlenmeyer! My joules!   |
| Someone has stolen my joules!" "Now,    |
| now, my dear," replied her husband,     |
| "keep your balance and reflux a moment. |
| Perhaps they're mislead." "No, I know   |
| they're stolen," cried Florence. "I     |
| remember putting them in my burette ... |
| We must call a copper." Erlenmeyer did  |
| so, and the flatfoot who turned up, one |
| Sherlock Ohms, said the outrage looked  |
| like the work of an arch-criminal by    |
| the name of Lawrence Ium. "We must be   |
| careful -- he's a free radical,         |
| ultraviolet, and dangerous. His         |
| girlfriend is a chlorine at the         |
| Palladium. Maybe I can catch him        |
| there." With that, he jumped on his     |
| carbon cycle in an activated state and  |
| sped off along the reaction pathway ... |
