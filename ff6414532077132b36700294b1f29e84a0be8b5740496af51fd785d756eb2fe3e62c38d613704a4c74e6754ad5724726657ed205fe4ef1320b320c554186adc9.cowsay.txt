/ The more a man is imbued with the       \
| ordered regularity of all events, the   |
| firmer becomes his conviction that      |
| there is no room left by the side of    |
| this ordered regularity for causes of a |
| different nature. For him neither the   |
| rule of human nor the rule of divine    |
| will exists as an independent cause of  |
| natural events. To be sure, the         |
| doctrine of a personal God interfering  |
| with natural events could never be      |
| refuted, in the real sense, by science, |
| for this doctrine can always take       |
| refuge in those domains in which        |
| scientific knowledge has not yet been   |
| able to set foot. But I am persuaded    |
| that such behavior on the part of the   |
| representatives of religion would not   |
| only be unworthy but also fatal. For a  |
| doctrine which is able to maintain      |
| itself not in clear light, but only in  |
| the dark, will of necessity lose its    |
| effect on mankind, with incalculable    |
| harm to human progress. In their        |
| struggle for the ethical good, teachers |
| of religion must have the stature to    |
| give up the doctrine of a personal God, |
| that is, give up that source of fear    |
| and hope which in the past placed such  |
| vast powers in the hands of priests. In |
| their labors they will have to avail    |
| themselves of those forces which are    |
| capable of cultivating the Good, the    |
| True, and the Beautiful in humanity     |
| itself. This is, to be sure, a more     |
| difficult but an incomparably more      |
\ worthy task. - Albert Einstein          /
