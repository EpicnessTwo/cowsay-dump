/ New York is a jungle, they tell you.    \
| You could go further, and say that New  |
| York is a jungle. New York *is a        |
| jungle.* Beneath the columns of the old |
| rain forest, made of melting macadam,   |
| the mean Limpopo of swamped Ninth       |
| Avenue bears an angry argosy of crocs   |
| and dragons, tiger fish, noise          |
| machines, sweating rainmakers. On the   |
| corners stand witchdoctors and          |
| headhunters, babbling voodoo-men -- the |
| natives, the jungle-smart natives. And  |
| at night, under the equatorial          |
| overgrowth and heat-holding cloud       |
| cover, you hear the ragged parrot-hoot  |
| and monkeysqueak of the sirens, and     |
| then fires flower to ward off monsters. |
| Careful: the streets are sprung with    |
| pits and nets and traps. Hire a guide.  |
| Pack your snakebite gook and your       |
| blowdart serum. Take it seriously. You  |
| have to get a bit jungle-wise. --       |
