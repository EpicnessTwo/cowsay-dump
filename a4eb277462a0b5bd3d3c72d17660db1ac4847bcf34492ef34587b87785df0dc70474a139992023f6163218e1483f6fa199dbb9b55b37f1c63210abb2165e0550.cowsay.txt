/ Proof techniques #1: Proof by           \
| Induction. This technique is used on    |
| equations with "_n" in them. Induction |
| techniques are very popular, even the   |
| military used them. SAMPLE: Proof of    |
| induction without proof of induction.   |
| We know it's true for _n equal to 1.   |
| Now assume that it's true for every     |
| natural number less than _n. _N is    |
| arbitrary, so we can take _n as large  |
| as we want. If _n is sufficiently      |
| large, the case of _n+1 is trivially   |
| equivalent, so the only important _n   |
| are _n less than _n. We can take _n  |
| = _n (from above), so it's true for    |
| _n+1 because it's just about _n. QED. |

\ what?")                                 /
