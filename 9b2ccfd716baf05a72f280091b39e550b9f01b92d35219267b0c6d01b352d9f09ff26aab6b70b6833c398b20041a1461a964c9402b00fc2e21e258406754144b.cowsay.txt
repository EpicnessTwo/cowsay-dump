/ The Worst Car Hire Service When David   \
| Schwartz left university in 1972, he    |
| set up Rent-a-wreck as a joke. Being a  |
| natural prankster, he acquired a fleet  |
| of beat-up shabby, wreckages waiting    |
| for the scrap heap in California. He    |
| put on a cap and looked forward to      |
| watching people's faces as he conducted |
| them round the choice of bumperless,    |
| dented junkmobiles. To his lasting      |
| surprise there was an insatiable demand |
| for them and he now has 26 thriving     |
| branches all over America. "People like |
| driving round in the worst cars         |
| available," he said. Of course they do. |
| "If a driver damages the side of a car  |
| and is honest enough to admit it, I     |
| tell him, `Forget it'. If they bring a  |
| car back late we overlook it. If        |
| they've had a crash and it doesn't      |
| involve another vehicle we might        |
| overlook that too." "Where's the        |
| ashtray?" asked on Los Angeles wife, as |
| she settled into the ripped interior.   |
| "Honey," said her husband, "the whole   |
| car's the ash tray." -- Stephen Pile,   |
