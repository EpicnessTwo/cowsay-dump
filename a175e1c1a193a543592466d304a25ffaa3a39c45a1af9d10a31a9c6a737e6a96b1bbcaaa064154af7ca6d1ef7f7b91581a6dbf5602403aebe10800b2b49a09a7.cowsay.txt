/ Gay shlafen: Yiddish for "go to sleep". \
| Now doesn't "gay shlafen" have a        |
| softer, more soothing sound than the    |
| harsh, staccato "go to sleep"? Listen   |
| to the difference: "Go to sleep, you    |
| little wretch!" ... "Gay shlafen,       |
| darling." Obvious, isn't it? Clearly    |
| the best thing you can do for you       |
| children is to start speaking Yiddish   |
| right now and never speak another word  |
| of English as long as you live. This    |
| will, of course, entail teaching        |
| Yiddish to all your friends, business   |
| associates, the people at the           |
| supermarket, and so on, but that's just |
| the point. It has to start with         |
| committed individuals and then grow.... |
| Some minor adjustments will have to be  |
| made, of course: those signs written in |
| what look like Yiddish letters won't be |
| funny when everything is written in     |
| Yiddish. And we'll have to start        |
| driving on the left side of the road so |
| we won't be reading the street signs    |
| backwards. But is that too high a price |
| to pay for world peace? I think not, my |
| friend, I think not. -- Arthur Naiman,  |
