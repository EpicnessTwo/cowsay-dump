/ [From an announcement of a congress of  \
| the International Ontopsychology        |
| Association, in Rome]: The              |
| Ontopsychological school, availing      |
| itself of new research criteria and of  |
| a new telematic epistemology, maintains |
| that social modes do not spring from    |
| dialectics of territory or of class, or |
| of consumer goods, or of means of       |
| power, but rather from dynamic          |
| latencies capillarized in millions of   |
| individuals in system functions which,  |
| once they have reached the event        |
| maturation, burst forth in catastrophic |
| phenomenology engaging a suitable       |
| stereotype protagonist or duty          |
| marionette (general, president,         |
| political party, etc.) to consummate    |
| the act of social schizophrenia in mass |
