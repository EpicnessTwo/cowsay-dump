/ And yet I should have dearly liked, I   \
| own, to have touched her lips; to have  |
| questioned her, that she might have     |
| opened them; to have looked upon the    |
| lashes of her downcast eyes, and never  |
| raised a blush; to have let loose waves |
| of hair, an inch of which would be a    |
| keepsake beyond price: in short, I      |
| should have liked, I do confess, to     |
| have had the lightest license of a      |
| child, and yet been man enough to know  |
\ its value. -- Charles Dickens           /
