/ "...I could accept this openness,       \
| glasnost, perestroika, or whatever you  |
| want to call it if they did these       |
| things: abolish the one party system;   |
| open the Soviet frontier and allow      |
| Soviet people to travel freely; allow   |
| the Soviet people to have real free     |
| enterprise; allow Western businessmen   |
| to do business there, and permit        |
| freedom of speech and of the press. But |
| so far, the whole country is like a     |
| concentration camp. The barbed wire on  |
| the fence around the Soviet Union is to |
| keep people inside, in the dark. This   |
| openness that you are seeing, all these |
| changes, are cosmetic and they have     |
| been designed to impress shortsighted,  |
| naive, sometimes stupid Western         |
| leaders. These leaders gush over        |
| Gorbachev, hoping to do business with   |
| the Soviet Union or appease it. He will |
| say: "Yes, we can do business!" This    |
| while his military machine in           |
| Afghanistan has killed over a million   |
| people out of a population of 17        |
| million. Can you imagine that? --       |
