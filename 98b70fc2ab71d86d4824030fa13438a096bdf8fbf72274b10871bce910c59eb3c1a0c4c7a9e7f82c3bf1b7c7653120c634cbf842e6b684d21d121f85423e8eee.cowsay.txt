/ Reporters like Bill Greider from the    \
| Washington Post and Him Naughton of the |
| New York Times, for instance, had to    |
| file long, detailed, and relatively     |
| complex stories every day -- while my   |
| own deadline fell every two weeks --    |
| but neither of them ever seemed in a    |
| hurry about getting their work done,    |
| and from time to time they would try to |
| console me about the terrible pressure  |
| I always seemed to be laboring under.   |
| Any $100-an-hour psychiatrist could     |
| probably explain this problem to me, in |
| thirteen or fourteen sessions, but I    |
| don't have time for that. No doubt it   |
| has something to do with a deep-seated  |
| personality defect, or maybe a kink in  |
| whatever blood vessel leads into the    |
| pineal gland... On the other hand, it   |
| might be something as simple &          |
| basically perverse as whatever instinct |
| it is that causes a jackrabbit to wait  |
| until the last possible second to dart  |
| across the road in front of a speeding  |
| car. -- Hunter S. Thompson, "Fear and   |
\ Loathing on the Campaign Trail"         /
