/ Well, anyway, I was reading this James  \
| Bond book, and right away I realized    |
| that like most books, it had too many   |
| words. The plot was the same one that   |
| all James Bond books have: An evil      |
| person tries to blow up the world, but  |
| James Bond kills him and his henchmen   |
| and makes love to several attractive    |
| women. There, that's it: 24 words. But  |
| the guy who wrote the book took         |
| *thousands* of words to say it. Or      |
| consider "The Brothers Karamazov", by   |
| the famous Russian alcoholic Fyodor     |
| Dostoyevsky. It's about these two       |
| brothers who kill their father. Or      |
| maybe only one of them kills the        |
| father. It's impossible to tell because |
| what they mostly do is talk for nearly  |
| a thousand pages. If all Russians talk  |
| as much as the Karamazovs did, I don't  |
| see how they found time to become a     |
| major world power. I'm told that        |
| Dostoyevsky wrote "The Brothers         |
| Karamazov" to raise the question of     |
| whether there is a God. So why didn't   |
| he just come right out and say: "Is     |
| there a God? It sure beats the heck out |
| of me." Other famous works could easily |
| have been summarized in a few words:    |
